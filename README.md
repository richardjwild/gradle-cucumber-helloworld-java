# gradle-cucumber-helloworld-java
A skeleton Java project for running Cucumber features with the gradle-cucumber plugin.

## To use it
1. Clone the repo.
2. Execute `gradle cucumber`.
3. That's it.

## Issues
So far I haven't been able to get Cucumber to work in the gradle plugin ~and~ in IntelliJ at the same time. I can get one or
the other to work, but not both.
